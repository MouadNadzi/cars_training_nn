# Autonomous Car Simulation with AI  

Welcome to our Autonomous Car Simulation project! This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence, using a combination of Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks, can train vehicles to navigate autonomously on various circuits.  

## ðŸ“š Overview  

The project simulates autonomous vehicles learning to navigate through different tracks by evolving their behaviors over generations. Each car's decision-making process is powered by a neural network, while a genetic algorithm optimizes their performance.  

## ðŸš€ Features  

- **Genetic Algorithm**:  
  Enables the evolution of car behaviors across generations, selecting the best-performing models and combining them to create new iterations.  

- **Neural Network**:  
  Used for decision-making in real-time, enabling cars to adapt to various challenges.  

- **Obstacle Detection**:  
  A raycasting system that allows cars to detect and respond to obstacles on the track.  

- **Multiple Tracks**:  
  Includes circuits with increasing difficulty, challenging the AI's learning capacity.  

- **Model Persistence**:  
  Save and load the best-performing models for continued testing and improvement.  

- **Customizable Interface**:  
  Adjust simulation parameters in real-time to fine-tune the learning process.
